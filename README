des-sn-tools
============

DES Supernova-related scripts and utilities. This repository is intended for
stand-alone scripts, as well as small DES-specific tools (with external
dependencies.

genFake
-------
Constains script to generate fakes for doFake in the diffim pipeline, using
SNANA. Depends on SNANA and can only be run at Fermilab.

scripts/GPS_cronjob_forSuominet.pl
----------------------------------
Cronjob to prepare GPS files for Suominet to measure precipitable
water vapor (PWV). Can only be run from Fermilab DES machines. See top
of script for more information and usage instructions.

scripts/GPS_cronjob_getResults.pl
---------------------------------
Cronjob to pull Suominet-analyzed results for CTIO and update a text
file in $DES_ROOT/GPS/SuominetResults/. Can only be run from Fermilab
DES machines.

scripts/get-des-lightcurves
---------------------------
Retrieves light curves of SN candidates from database, writes each to
a file in chosen directory. Requires NumPy, cx_Oracle and desdb python
packages.  For full option list and useage instructions, run with no
arguments and `-h` or `--help` option.


scripts/make_lcdr.pl
--------------------
Top-level script to extract light curves from Oracle
and create data files in multiple formats that are 
web-accessible at
  http://sdssdp62.fnal.gov/sdsssn/SNANA-PUBLIC/INTERNAL/DES/data/
See comment at top of make_lcdr.pl for more details.


scripts/convertdbExtract2snana.pl
---------------------------------
Convert csv-formatted data files (created by get-des-lightcurves)
into snana/text format. This script is also used by make_lcdr.pl.


scripts/get-des-obsinfo
-----------------------
Retrieve observing conditions (image metadata) for a random set of
positions from the database, write to an SNANA "SIMLIB" format file.
Requires NumPy, cx_Oracle and desdb packages.  For full option list
and useage instructions, run with no arguments and `-h` or `--help`
option.


scripts/match-des-hosts.py
--------------------------
Match transient candidates in SNCAND table to potential host 
galaxies in SVA1_COADD merged with photo-z catalog (from Huan Lin).
Output is currently a text file, but eventually a separate script 
will insert the matches to the SNGALS table.
