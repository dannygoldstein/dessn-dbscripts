des-sn-tools
============

DES Supernova-related scripts and utilities. This repository is intended for
stand-alone scripts and modular functionality (such as python modules), as
well as small DES-specific tools with external dependencies. The top-level
directories are briefly described here. For more information see the README
in each directory.

genFake
-------
Constains script to generate fakes for doFake in the diffim pipeline, using
SNANA. Depends on SNANA and is specific to running at Fermilab.

gps
---
Contains script to prepare GPS files for Suominet to measure precipitable
water vapor (PWV). Specific to running on Fermilab DES machines.

python
------
Contains a python module `dessn` with random DES-related functionality, and a
script `get-des-lightcurves` for downloading lightcurves from the database.
Depends on the NumPy, cx_Oracle and desdb packages.
