DES Supernova-related scripts and utilities. This repository is intended for
stand-alone scripts, as well as small DES-specific tools (with external
dependencies.

Cronjob to prepare GPS files for Suominet to measure precipitable
water vapor (PWV). Can only be run from Fermilab DES machines. See top
