In order to run post processing on a field, you need the following:

python
  cx_Oracle
  numpy
  sys

You will also need a DESOPER db account and password.  The dumby values in the python script won't get you anywhere.  I need to go through and set environmental values of my own so that I can just reference the same environmental varaibles as you.

To run the script, just do this:

python dessnpostprocessingbyfield.py <fieldname>

example:

python dessnpostprocessingbyfield.py X3
